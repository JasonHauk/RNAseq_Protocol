# RNAseq_Protocol
Using the data located in the data folder and the Notebook at Notebooks/RNAseq_Example.ipynb users have code that allow them to generate any plots requested for RNA seq analysis. Examples of these results can be found in the results section.

Additionally, I've included a barebones sample of Motif Analysis so that it is easy to see the process Seiichi and I used to generate Genome Motifs.
